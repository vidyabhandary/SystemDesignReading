**Sharding is a core feature in many NoSQL databases.** Here's how it works and how sharding in NoSQL differs from sharding in traditional SQL databases:

### Sharding in NoSQL Databases

- **Native Support:** Many NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra are designed for sharding from the ground up, providing *built-in* and often *automatic* support for distributed data storage.
- **Partitioning Logic:** Data is distributed across shards using key-based distribution methods (e.g., consistent hashing, hash-based, range-based), with each *shard* being a subset of the full dataset.
- **Scaling:** Sharding in NoSQL allows for easy horizontal scaling, as data can be automatically balanced and migrated across new or removed nodes with minimal manual intervention.
- **Implementation Example:**


### Sharding in SQL Databases

- **Manual \& More Complex:** Traditional relational (SQL) databases are not inherently designed for sharding, so implementing it is more **manual and complex**.
- **ACID Considerations:** SQL databases must maintain ACID properties, making sharding more challenging due to the need for transactional integrity across shards.
- **Shard Examples:** Typically, separate physical databases are created (e.g., `shard1`, `shard2`), and data is routed into each based on a sharding key like user ID range or a hash function.
- **Implementation Example:**
    - Data for users with ID 1–100 go to `shard1`; users with higher IDs go to `shard2`.


### Key Differences: NoSQL vs SQL Sharding

| Aspect | NoSQL Sharding | SQL Sharding |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Native Support** | Built-in, automatic, and part of the core product | Manual setup, not natively supported in most RDBMS |
| **Schema Flexibility**     | Schemaless design simplifies distributing records                | Fixed schema complicates distributing related tables     |
| **Scaling** | Easy, often automatic rebalancing| Complex, requires manual data migration and management |
| **ACID Transactions** | Often relaxed for scalability (eventual consistency) | Must manually address ACID requirements (transactions, joins) |
| **Partitioning Logic** | Key-based (hash, range, geographic), with support for complex routing | Range/hash partitioning; requires complex application logic |
| **Administration** | Tools and APIs for sharding; minimal manual effort | Extensive operational complexity |

**In summary:**

- **Sharding is not only possible in NoSQL databases—it is a core strength of their architecture.**
- The main difference is that **NoSQL systems provide built-in, automatic, and flexible sharding**, while **SQL databases require manual setup and face challenges with ACID properties and operational complexity**.
